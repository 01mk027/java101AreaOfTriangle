## Description
This small project is made for Java101 course on "patika.dev". Aim of the project is to calculate area of triangle. Lengths of 3 edges of triangle is entered by user on keyboard. And then, result of application of theory, area is calculated and printed to screen.

## Brief Theory
Assume that <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> represents lengths of 3 edges of triangle.

Perimeter of triangle is:
2*<i>u</i> = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>c</i>

And area of triangle is:
<span>&#8730;<i>area<sup>2</sup></i></span> = <span>&#8730;<i>u</i> * <i>(u - a)</i> * <i>(u - b)</i> * <i>(u - c)</i></span>
